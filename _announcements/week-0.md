In CEVE101, students will explore how data science, environmental science, economic analysis, structural design, and systems thinking can be integrated to promote sustainability, resilience, and equity.
Through a mix of technical lectures, topical seminars on applications and ideas of interest, and team-based projects, students will develop an understanding of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering and its applications.
The course is organized into four modules (energy systems, drinking water systems, urban mobility, and coastal resilience) which sample the breadth of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
