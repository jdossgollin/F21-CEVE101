In CEVE101, students will explore how data science, environmental science, economic analysis, structural design, and systems thinking can be integrated to promote sustainability, resilience, and equity.
Through a mix of technical lectures, topical seminars on applications and ideas of interest, and team-based projects, students will develop an understanding of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering and its applications.

On completing this course, students should be able to:

- Identify civil and environmental engineering subfields
- Successfully perform engineering problem solving in several civil and environmental subfields
- Generate report-quality engineering calculations
- Create and present an oral report on a design project
- Collaborate with peers in project teams and in composing project reports
