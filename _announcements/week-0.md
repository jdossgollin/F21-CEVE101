If you are considering a major in Civil and Environmental Engineering, consider taking our revamped introductory course
{: .fs-5 }

In CEVE101, students will explore how data science, environmental science, economic analysis, structural design, and systems thinking can be integrated to promote sustainability, resilience, and equity.
Through a mix of technical lectures, topical seminars on applications and ideas of interest, and team-based projects, students will develop an understanding of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering and its applications.
The course is organized into four modules (energy systems, drinking water systems, urban mobility, and coastal resilience) which sample the breadth of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The specific objectives of this course are to provide:  

- an understanding of the scope of civil and environmental engineering;
- an understanding of the academic activities of the Rice CEVE department;
- exposure to fundamental principles, concepts, and approaches that apply across CEVE disciplines, including quantitative reasoning and creative problem solving;
- a context for applying information from other first-year courses, especially calculus and physics;
- a background for higher level classes in civil and environmental engineering;
- an appreciation for the many links between the practice of civil and environmental engineering and social goals including sustainability, resilience, and equity;
- a sampling of possible career paths within the field of civil and environmental engineering, and their requirements;
- and some experience with the fun of being an engineer.
