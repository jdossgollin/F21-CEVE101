## A Community of Learning

Rice's [core values](https://www.rice.edu/mission-values) are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence.
Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.

### COVID-19

We are experiencing a deadly global pandemic that has challenged us all in different ways.
Despite challenges, we can and will get through this together!

1. Respect the health and safety of your classmates and instructors. Follow all policies posted at [https://coronavirus.rice.edu/](https://coronavirus.rice.edu/), including around mask wearing and testing. Do not come to class if you feel unwell, even if it's not COVID.
1. Empathize with your classmates.
1. Include any classmates who aren't able to join us in person. Use tools like Zoom, Google Drive, and Slack to organize team projects.
1. Reach out to your instructors if you need an extension or other accommodations. We're here to support you, but you need to tell us what you need.

### Attendance

Class attendance and note-taking is essential in this course.
Material is covered in class that is not in the handouts.
Students are responsible for all material in lectures, reading assignments, and any supporting information necessary to understand the assignments.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Rice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.
Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.
Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus.
We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.
We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.
They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted in this course is subject to the [Rice Honor Code](http://honor.rice.edu/).

Students are required to do individual work on individual assessments.
Discussions with other students about concepts and overall approaches to completing individual assignments are permitted, but copying from another student’s assignment constitutes plagiarism, which is a violation of academic integrity.
Using information directly from websites, books, papers and other literary sources without appropriate attribution is also plagiarism.

Assignments submitted for this class will be reviewed by the instructor and may be scanned through web-based academic integrity software.
Occurrences of cheating or plagiarism will be handled according to the university honor code.
Students are expected to have read this policy and conform to the highest standards of academic integrity.

If you are unsure if a specific action or activity constitutes unacceptable collaboration or cheating, ASK FIRST.

### Policy on Web Posting of Course Materials

Uploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material.
Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable.

### Accommodation for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me, or have the Disability Resource Center reach out to me, at least one week prior to the first exam.
I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.
If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Disability Resource Center, I strongly encourage you to [reach out to them](https://drc.rice.edu/).

### Accommodation for Religious Events

If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements with you.

### Class Decorum

The classroom is a professional educational setting, and students should view themselves as members in a peer community.
Disrespectful behavior is not acceptable in a professional setting and will not be tolerated in the classroom.

## Materials

### Textbook

No textbook is required.
All readings will be posted on Canvas.
You may need to access material in Fondren Library, and to access journal articles.

## Assignments and Grading

I reserve the right to curve the scale dependent on overall class scores at the end of the semester.
I will assign grades using the following numeric to grade conversion scale:

| <60 | 60 | 63 | 67 | 70 | 73 | 77 | 80 | 83 | 87 | 90 | ≤93 |
| F   |  D- | D | D+ | C- | C  | C+ | B- | B  | B+ | A- | A   |

**All assignments to be submitted on Canvas in `PDF` format**.
You are welcome to complete your assignment by hand and scan it using a free application such as [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html), but please check for legibility before submitting.
There are also scanners that you can use, e.g. [in Fondren](https://library.rice.edu/services/copy-print-scan).

### Problem Sets

Regular homework assignments, often called "problem sets" in engineering, are integral to learning.
There will be problem sets on the material covered in class and in the handouts.
The specifications in the Homework Preparation Guide for the course must be followed so please read these carefully.
Each assignment has a summary page that functions both as a rubric and grading sheet.
It must be submitted as a cover sheet for each assignment.
The rubric provides important information regarded grading, and students are encouraged to review it prior to beginning problems.

### Reading Reflections

In order to foster a discussion-based class format, readings will be assigned before each class.
A brief reflection or exercise based on the reading will also be assigned, and will be due at the start of class.
Reading reflections will be graded as either complete (full points), partially complete (half points), or incomplete (no points).
No other partial credit will be offered.
No late reading assignments will be accepted, but the lowest three will be dropped.

Please bring your reading reflection with you to class; you may be called upon and asked to share your thoughts.

### Group Projects

There will be four group projects in the course.
These projects will be conducted in groups of four to five people.
Groups will be assigned by the instructor.
The projects will require coordinated group effort.
There will be peer evaluation after each project, and peer ratings will be used in calculating individual scores for group projects.

### Grading

| Reading Reflections   | Due every class   | 20% |
| Problem sets   | Approximately biweekly   | 15% |
| Project 1   | Oral presentation | 15% |
| Project 2   | Digital presentation | 15% |
| Project 3   | Policy brief | 15%  |
| Project 4   | Final Report | 20% |
