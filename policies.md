## A Community of Learning

Rice's [core values](https://www.rice.edu/mission-values) are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence.
Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.

### Attendance

Class attendance and note-taking is essential in this course.
Material is covered in class that is not in the handouts.
Students are responsible for all material in lectures, reading assignments, and any supporting information necessary to understand the assignments.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Rice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.
Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.
Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus.
We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.
We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.
They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted in this course is subject to the [Rice Honor Code](http://honor.rice.edu/).

Students are required to do individual work on individual assessments.
Discussions with other students about concepts and overall approaches to completing individual assignments are permitted, but copying from another student’s assignment constitutes plagiarism, which is a violation of academic integrity.
Using information directly from websites, books, papers and other literary sources without appropriate attribution is also plagiarism.

Assignments submitted for this class will be reviewed by the instructor and may be scanned through web-based academic integrity software.
Occurrences of cheating or plagiarism will be handled according to the university honor code.
Students are expected to have read this policy and conform to the highest standards of academic integrity.

If you are unsure if a specific action or activity constitutes unacceptable collaboration or cheating, ASK FIRST.

### Policy on Web Posting of Course Materials

Uploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material. Posting and/or using these materials is defined as Cheating per the University Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism under "1. Theft of or unauthorized access to an exam, answer key or other graded work from previous course offerings."  Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable. All of the videos produced by the instructor are copyrighted material and cannot be posted or shared outside of class without written permission.

### Accommodation for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me, or have the Disability Resources office reach out to me, at least one week prior to the first exam. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu. Disability Resources, 102 Whitfield Hall 412.268.2013.

### Accomodation for Religious Events

If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements with you.

### Class Decorum

The classroom is a professional educational setting, and students should view themselves as members in a peer community. Disrespectful behavior is not acceptable in a professional setting and will not be tolerated in the classroom.  


## Materials

### Textbook

There is no required textbook, and material will be covered by Handouts that are distributed in class and posted on Canvas. An extensive treatment of some topics introduced in this course is found in the textbook Project Management for Construction, Hendrickson and Au, which those CEE Professors have graciously placed in the public domain at https://www.cmu.edu/cee/projects/PMbook/.  and readings from that textbook are listed in the syllabus.
Additional required readings will be posted on the course Canvas site.

### Required Materials

The only materials required is a pad of green engineering paper (100-sheet should be fine) for homework, a 6-inch, one 30 or 45 or 90 degree triangle (doesn't matter which kind or material), a mechanical pencil, and a separate eraser. You can get these wherever you want. The CMU bookstore has everything but the triangle, the CMU art store has all of these items.  

## Assignments and Grading

I reserve the right to curve the scale dependent on overall class scores at the end of the semester.
I will assign grades using the following numeric to grade conversion scale:

| <60 | 60 | 63 | 67 | 70 | 73 | 77 | 80 | 83 | 87 | 90 | ≤93 |
| F   |  D- | D | D+ | C- | C  | C+ | B- | B  | B+ | A- | A   |

All assignments to be submitted on Canvas **in PDF format**.

### Problem Sets

Regular “homework” assignments, often called “problem sets” in engineering, are integral to learning.  There will be problem sets on the material covered in class and in the handouts.  Solutions must be submitted in a professional manner using engineering paper.  The specifications in the Homework Preparation Guide for the course must be followed so please read these carefully.  Each assignment has a summary page that functions both as a rubric and grading sheet.  It must be submitted as a cover sheet for each assignment.  The rubric provides important information regarded grading, and students are encouraged to review it prior to beginning problems.  

### Reading Reflections

In order to foster a discussion-based class format, mandatory readings will be assigned before each class.
A brief reflection or exercise based on the reading will also be assigned, and will be due at the start of class.
Reading reflections will be graded as either complete (full points), partially complete (half points), or incomplete (no points).
No other partial credit will be offered.
No late reading assignments will be accepted, but the lowest five will be dropped.

### Projects

Group Projects and Presentations:  There will be three group projects in the course.  These projects will be conducted in groups of four to five people.  Groups will be assigned by the instructor.  The projects will require coordinated group effort.  There will be peer evaluation after each project, and peer ratings will be used in calculating individual scores for group projects.  There will be written and oral reports for each project.  Only some groups will give oral presentations for each project.  All students will have an opportunity to make an oral presentation during the semester.  In the oral presentations, each member of the group will present a portion of the overall report.  Detailed guidance for the content of the written and oral reports will be distributed.  

### Grading (subject to change)

| Reading Reflections   | Due every class   | 20% |
| Problem sets   | Approximately biweekly   | 20% |
| Project 1   | Group presentations | 15%  |
| Project 3   | Group report | 15% |
| Project 3   | Team debate | 10% |
| Project 4   | Group presentation and report | 20% |
