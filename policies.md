## A Community of Learning

Rice's [core values](https://www.rice.edu/mission-values) are responsibility, integrity, community, and excellence.
Our goal is to create a learning community aligned with these core values.

### Attendance

Class attendance and note-taking is essential in this course.
Material is covered in class that is not in the handouts.
Students are responsible for all material in lectures, reading assignments, and any supporting information necessary to understand the assignments.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Rice is committed to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.
Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.
Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus.
We, at Rice, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.
We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional.
They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university.

### Rice Honor Code

In this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at
this institution.
If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at [honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/](https://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/).
This handbook outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.

If you have any questions, ask first!

### Policy on Web Posting of Course Materials

Uploading course materials to web sites is not an authorized use of the course material.
Both the poster and the user are in violation of the university policy, which is actionable.

### Accommodation for Students with Disabilities

If you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should: 1) make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / [adarice@rice.edu](mailto:adarice@rice.edu) / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and 2) talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.

### Accommodation for Religious Events

If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements with you.


## Materials

### Textbook

All readings will be posted on Canvas.
You will need to access digital material from Fondren Library, including journal articles.

## Assignments and Grading

I reserve the right to curve the scale dependent on overall class scores at the end of the semester.
I will assign grades using the following numeric to grade conversion scale:

| <60 | 60 | 63 | 67 | 70 | 73 | 77 | 80 | 83 | 87 | 90 | â‰¤93 |
| F   |  D- | D | D+ | C- | C  | C+ | B- | B  | B+ | A- | A   |

**All assignments to be submitted on Canvas in `PDF` format**.
You are welcome to complete your assignment by hand and scan it using a free application such as [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html), but please check for legibility before submitting.
There are also scanners that you can use, e.g. [in Fondren](https://library.rice.edu/services/copy-print-scan).

### Problem Sets

Regular homework assignments, often called "problem sets" in engineering, are integral to learning.
The role of problem sets in this course is to give you a chance to apply the tools we cover in class to new contexts.
Problem sets are designed to take approximately five hours; if you find yourself spending more than ten hours on them, please come to office hours to discuss!

Problem sets will be due at 2:29PM on the days assigned -- i.e., right before class starts.
Late problem sets will not be accepted -- turn in whatever you have.
This allows us to discuss the problem set in class while it's still fresh in everyone's mind.
We will drop at least the lowest 1 problem set.

### Reading Reflections

In order to foster a discussion-based class format, readings will be assigned before each class.
A brief reflection or exercise based on the reading will also be assigned, and will be due at the start of class.
Reading reflections will be graded as either complete (2 points), partially complete (1 point), or incomplete (0 points).
No late reading assignments will be accepted, but the lowest three will be dropped.

Problem sets will be due at 1:30PM on the days assigned -- i.e., one hour before class starts.
This allows me to read through these responses as I prepare for class.
Late problem sets will lose one point.
Please bring your reading reflection with you to class; you may be called upon and asked to share your thoughts.

### Group Projects

There will be four group projects in the course.
These projects will be conducted in groups of four to five people.
Groups will be assigned by the instructor.
The projects will require coordinated group effort.
There will be peer evaluation after each project, and peer ratings will be used in calculating individual scores for group projects.

### Grading

| Reading Reflections   | Due every class   | 20% |
| Problem sets   | Approximately biweekly   | 15% |
| Project 1   | Oral presentation | 15% |
| Project 2   | Digital presentation | 15% |
| Project 3   | Policy brief | 15%  |
| Project 4   | Final Report | 20% |
