## Assignments and Grading

### Reading Reflections

In order to foster a discussion-based class format, mandatory readings will be assigned before each class.
A brief reflection or exercise based on the reading will also be assigned, and will be due at the start of class.
Reading reflections will be graded as either complete (full points), partially complete (half points), or incomplete (no points).
No other partial credit will be offered.
No late reading assignments will be accepted, but the lowest five will be dropped.

### Projects

Over the course of the semester, four group projects will be assigned.
Your groups will be randomized for each project.
For project 1, you will develop a presentation in class.
For project 2, you will write a policy report as a group.
For project 3, you will particpate in an in-class debate.
For project 4, you will write a report and present highlights to the course.
