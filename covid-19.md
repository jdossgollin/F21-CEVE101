We are experiencing a deadly global pandemic that has challenged us all in different ways.
We can and will get through this together!

## Mode of Instruction

In accordance with an email sent out by the Provost on August 19, there will be no class on August 24th.
Instruction will be virtual (on Zoom, but synchronous) on August 26th, August 31st, and September 2nd.
I hope we can safely meet in person soon, but if not we will adapt as necessary.

## What You Can Do

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

1. Respect the health and safety of your classmates and instructors. Follow all policies posted at [https://coronavirus.rice.edu/](https://coronavirus.rice.edu/), *including around mask wearing and testing.* Do not make your classmates or instructor repeatedly remind you about safety policies.
1. Do not come to class if you feel unwell, even if it's not COVID. Do not come to class if you think you may have been exposed to COVID, even if it's not confirmed.  (I'll make sure you don't fall behind!)
1. Empathize with your classmates and instructors.
1. Include your classmates who aren't able to join us in person. Use tools like Zoom, Google Drive, and Slack to organize team projects.

## What I'm Doing

It's my job to help this class navigate this pandemic.

1. If you need an extension or other resources, reach out. I'm here to help, but I can't help if you don't tell me how.
1. Attendance is strongly encouraged, but is not mandatory. All course materials are (or can be made) available online, including lectures and discussion. If you can't come to class, you won't fall behind.
1. We are using a "flipped" classroom: lectures and reading will be pre-recorded and available on Canvas so that remote participants don't miss anything. In class (streamed on Zoom as needed) we will discuss readings, work through practice problems, and examine case studies.
1. Office hours are available outdoors or via Zoom.
1. Class communication will happen on Slack. This gives us a way to stay connected even if we're interacting less in person.
