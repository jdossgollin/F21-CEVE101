Here are some useful resources that are not tied to a particular class

* To access Rice library resources off-campus (e.g., academic papers), see [Fondren Library guidance](https://library.rice.edu/offcampus)
* [Zotero](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/lab-guide/toolkit/zotero/) makes it easy to keep track of references and cite them correctly
* [Boosting the signal in scientific talks](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00838-3) will help you give better talks
