## Course Description

Civil and Environmental Engineers (CEVEs) engage in the planning, design, construction, operation, retrofit, demolition, and reuse of infrastructure systems that form the backbone of societies and economies.
CEVEs work at the dynamic interface of the built environment, information environment, and natural environment on topics like smart cities and construction, sustainable energy and buildings, connected and automated transportation systems, resilient infrastructure, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and water management.
In this course, students will explore how data science, environmental science, economic analysis,  structural design, and systems thinking can be integrated to promote sustainability, resilience, and equity.
Through a mix of technical lectures, topical seminars on applications and ideas of interest, and team-based projects, students will develop an understanding of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering and its applications.

## Course Objectives

This course is intended to introduce you to the discipline of civil and environmental engineering through examination of topics in energy systems, water systems, urban mobility, and coastal resilience.
This course emphasizes analytical skills, systems thinking, communication, and teamwork.

The course aims to provide:  

- an understanding of the scope of civil and environmental engineering;
- an understanding of the academic activities of the Rice CEVE department;
- exposure to fundamental principles, concepts, and approaches that apply across CEVE disciplines, including quantitative reasoning and creative problem solving;
- a context for applying information from other first-year courses, especially calculus and physics;
- a background for higher level classes in civil and environmental engineering;
- an appreciation for the many links between the practice of civil and environmental engineering and social goals including sustainability, resilience, and equity;
- and some experience with the fun of being an engineer.

## Learning Objectives

On completing this course, students should be able to:

- Identify civil and environmental engineering subfields
- Successfully perform engineering problem solving in several civil and environmental subfields
- Generate report-quality engineering calculations
- Create and present an oral report on a design project
- Collaborate with peers in project teams and in composing project reports
