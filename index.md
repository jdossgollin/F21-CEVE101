## Course Description

Civil and Environmental Engineers (CEVEs) engage in the planning, design, construction, operation, retrofit, demolition, and reuse of large-scale infrastructure that forms the backbone of all societies and economies.
CEVEs work at the dynamic interface of the built environment, information environment, and natural environment.
Therefore, societal domains that require CEVE expertise include smart cities and construction, sustainable energy and buildings, connected and automated transportation systems, resilient infrastructure, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and water management.
Students will explore how data science, environmental science, life cycle systems and economic analysis, and structural design are integrated to create a built environment that promotes **sustainability, resilience, and equity**.
Students work on team-based design-build projects that introduce principles from environmental, structural, construction engineering, and project management.
Students learn technical skills as well as design considerations that include uncertainty, economics, and ethics, for modern and future infrastructure.
